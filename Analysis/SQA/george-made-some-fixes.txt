Fixed:
SR2  (section 3 definition sentence capitalization)
SR40 (back to top links)
SR41 (object names are now top aligned to their table rows)
SR42 (side spacing? didn't understand exactly the problem but this may be a fix)
SR43 (section heading is too far from the number)
SR44 (bottom captions changed to top labels)

Notes:
SR42 and SR43 ruin the alignment as follows:

{num}       {section title}
            {num}     {sub section title}

In favour of this (slightly more dynamic) structure (which *cant* be aligned):

{num} {section title}
          {num} {section title}

Judgement call. I think the second option looks worse, but I wont say no to SQA.
