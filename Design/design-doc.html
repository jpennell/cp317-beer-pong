				<h3 class="heading2"><span class="number">1.1</span>Document Overview</h3>
				<p>
					This is the Design document for Pong Tracker, an online website which
					allows users to track their Beer Pong playing skills and compare them to others.
					This is part of the project documentation for CP317 during the Spring 2013 semester.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first part is an overview of the governing guidelines for this project. The second
					part is about the logical design involving the architecture of Pong Tracker
					and how various elements interact. The contents of each package is described
					as is the database which the project will use. The third part
					covers the design of methods to be implemented. The
					fourth part will cover Django, our selecected web framework for
					implementation. The fifth part will act as an introduction to front end
					prototyping concluding with the final parts being references and SQA Version History.

					<h4 class="heading3"><span class="number">1.3.1</span>Technical Guidelines</h4>
					<p>
						Pong Tracker is hosted on a Sun Microsystem Linux Server with a MySQL database.
						The Linux server must be able to serve HTML 5 and CSS 3. Intepretation of Python 2.7 is required.
<<<<<<< HEAD
						The server is also required to integrate with the Django web framework and Git.
						Django is a strong web framework with many tools built in such as sessions, and database APIs; Django will be discussed in detail later.
						The only concern is the implemention is using Python 2.7 when the current version is 3.3.2. 2.7 has been selected
=======
						The server is also required to integrate with the Django 1.5 web framework and Git.
						Django is a strong web framework with many tools built in such as sessions, and database APIs; Django will be discussed in detail later.

					<section>
						<h4 class="heading3"><span class="number">2.2.5</span>Django Package</h4>
						<p>
							Due to the closed architecture of Django, Django's low level design is unknown.  Functionalities it does however

				<section>
					<h3 class="heading2"><span class="number">2.3</span>Database Design</h3>
					<p>The following diagram shows the Pong Tracker database design. The following are a list of Django generated tables: </p>

					<ul>
						<li>auth_group</li>
						<li>auth_group_permissions</li>
						<li>django_session</li>
						<li>django_content_type</li>
						<li>auth_permission</li>
						<li>django_admin_log</li>
						<li>User_ponguser_user_permissions</li>
						<li>User_ponguser*</li>
					</ul>

					<p>*The User_ponguser table is an extension of the User model defined by Django.</p>

					<p>Any attributes defined by us begin with an underscore and are written in camel case. An example of this is _isBanned in the User_ponguser table. The only exceptions are foreign keys. Django automatically appends "_id" to the end of the attribute name. An example of this is _user_id in the Game_event table. In the model definitions in the Django project, the "_id" does not appear. </p>

					<p>Any Django generated attributes are written in lower case with underscores between works. An example of this is first_name in the User_ponguser table.</p>

			<h2 class="heading1"><span class="number">4</span>Django Web Framework</h2>
			<section>
				<h3 class="heading2"><span class="number">4.1</span>Framework Description & Functionality</h3>
					<p>
						Django is a strong web framework with many tools built in such as session handling, caching,
						authentication, and database APIs. Django focuses on taking a lot of the work away from the
						developer allowing for easier, more rapid development.
					</p>
					<p>
						One word sums up how Django works, Magic. In more specific terms Django works by processing
						a given URL against registered URLs and calling view associated with the URL. The view then
						uses the required models, potentially updating the database, and returns a HttpResponse object.
						This response is either a redirect or render of a template (HTML page) which can then be displayed
						to the user. The majority of these templates incorporate buttons that trigger posts to URLs which
						start the process all over again.
					</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 class="heading2"><span class="number">4.2</span>How Django is Used</h3>
					<p>
						In order to use Django, the libraries are first imported for a developer to run
						to create the  project. With a project a developer can create apps; the equivalent of packages.
						These packages contain the models, views, forms, templates, URLs, and tests for their respective package.
						Once the project is started a developer can start to hook up the models, templates, and views in
						a model view controller fashion.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are currently using the Django libraries for administration, authentication, sessions, and static files.
						The student group on hopper does not have permissions to create databases as such the testing was rewritten in order to perform unit testing.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the django.contrib package are many tools available to developers we have selected several:
						<ul>
							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/"><h4 class="heading3">auth</h4></a>
								Django's built in authentication framework. This system handles the various parts associated
								with a user: accounts, permissions, groups, and cookie-based user session. It provides password
								hashing, and basic user forms. It does not however provide password strength checking, throttling
								or login attempts. When the database is synced the required tables are generated taking another step
								away from the developer. This package is dependent upon the contenttypes app and session, and authentication
								middleware.
							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/http/sessions/"><h4 class="heading3">sessions</h4></a>

								Django's session framework allows a developer to store and retrieve values in the session. Each user
								has one session which is stored on the server side, abstracting the sending and receiving of cookies. Sessions are
								dependent upon the SessionMiddleware middleware that is included with Django. While Django does over cookie
								session support we have selected the default of database-backed session.


							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/messages/"><h4 class="heading3">messages</h4></a>
								Django allows developers to send one time messages to a user by using cookie or session based messaging.
								The frame work allows for the temporary storage of messages in one request and the retrieval of it in another.
								The message can be retrieved by templates in the html to display to the user.
								Each message has a tag declaring its priority level. Messaging is dependent upon SessionMiddleware,
								MessageMiddleware, and django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages as a template context
								processor.
							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/staticfiles/"><h4 class="heading3">staticfiles</h4></a>
								Staticfiles uses finders to gather the static files associated with the project into a single location.
								Staticfiles is used by defining the listing the location of static files in the STATICFILES_DIRS variable of
								settings.py. We are using this framework to incorporate our CSS files into the project.

							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/admin/"><h4 class="heading3">admin</h4></a>
								The Django admin site is a tool that automatically generates a admin interface based upon several
								assumptions that Django makes. The admin file of each app can also be to specify which models are
								editable by administrators and the forms that the admin page implements.
								Our project has overridden part of the user admin page to better reflect the
								specification of our requirements documentation. The admin site talks to the database and any
								changes made on the site will be reflected in the database.
								The admin site has the following dependencies:
								<ul>
									<li>Installed apps: auth, contenttypes, messages, and sessions</li>
									<li>Middleware: AuthenticationMiddleware, and MessageMidleware</li>
								</ul>

							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/contenttypes/"><h4 class="heading3">contenttypes</h4></a>
								The contenttypes application keeps track of all the models in the project, providing an interface for developers to use.
								Contenttypes facilitates the creation of models and can provides methods to access the values on them, however we have
								moved away from that to go with a more getter and setter approach.

							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/humanize/"><h4 class="heading3">humanize</h4></a>
								At the time of writing no decision has been made to implement the humanize framework it is however
								worth highlighting. The humanize framework essentially makes values on a template more appealing to a user.
								It does this by adding commas to large numbers, converting integers to words, or converting date objects to
								a phrase with respect to the current time i.e. 29 seconds ago.
						</ul>

						Django also provides middleware to aid in solving many web development issues.
						The selected middleware not related directly to the django.contrib package is described below:

						<ul>
							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/middleware/"><h4 class="heading3">django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware</h4></a>
								The CommonMiddleware included provides functions such as appending slashes to urls, adding 'www', and
								emailing site managers if issues arise.
							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/contrib/csrf/"><h4 class="heading3">django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware</h4></a>
								The Csrf protection middleware provides protection from cross site request forgeries.
								All POST forms that target internal urls are given a csrf_token ensuring that protection is provided.
						</ul>
						The Django library itself consists of many additional packages, libraries, APIs and features for developers to use:
						<ul>
							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/forms/"><h4 class="heading3">django.forms</h4></a>
								The form API provides a easy way to set up a quick html form. The form API generates
								html based upon the form class provided to the url and processed in the template.
								By using forms developers inherit  basic form validation and are given the ability to write their
								own either for specific fields or entire forms. Forms can also implement widgets to represent html tags
								such as passwords. By using a forms.ModelForm a form can be made to represent a model directly. If the variables
								of the field are named exactly like the attributes of the model then they will be auto populated by the
								database values. Django provides several basic forms that can be extended or over written for more
								specific implementation.

							<h4 class="heading3">Django Database handling</h4>
								Django provides a wide range of functionality for many kinds of databases; we have selected mySQL. When the admin app is turned on running
								syncdb will create all the required tables and relations for administration. By using developer defined
								models Django is able to generate all the SQL and create the tables with relations for each model.
								Accessing values in the database then no longer requires mySQL statements but can be done using
								methods on model instances such as orderby() or filter(). The database can also be preloaded with test data
								by using fixtures and then loaded into the db.

							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/testing/"><h4 class="heading3">Testing with Django</h4></a>
								Django provides testing automation however it has several issues. Issues that we have encountered consist of:
								<ul>
									<li>Requires the creation of a test_database, which is not available to the student group on hopper.</li>
									<li>Runs a large number of tests irrelevant to the project itself.</li>
								</ul>
								In order to combat these issues Django provides the ability to create custom test runners which can
								run with the creation of a new schema. Django provides integration with the python unittest library and a custom
								test runner can be written to use unittest2
							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/http/shortcuts/"><h4 class="heading3">django.shortcuts </h4></a>
								The Django shortcut package is a collection of helper functions that cover multiple levels of the MVC
								design pattern. This package deals with functions such as render, and redirect which handle the decision
								of which template to display. These functions provide the option of passing context and requests to templates
								for them to process. It also gives 404 page functionality.

							<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/urls/"><h4 class="heading3">django.conf.urls </h4></a>
								Django.conf.urls contains several utility functions. These functions are used to handle urls.
								Using the include() function urls can be spread across multiple apps allowing for better coupling and cohesion.
								By using patterns() developers are able to create a list of url() objects to register with the site. The url objects
								are also able to obtain data from the session and redirect to views.
						</ul>

						To find the required files Django employs several finders and loaders:
						<ul>
							<li>django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder</li>
							<li>django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder</li>
							<li>django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader</li>
							<li>django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader</li>
						</ul>

					</p>

			<section>
				<h3 class="heading2"><span class="number">4.2</span>How Django is Used</h3>
					<p>
						In order to use Django a developer must install Django and run the startproject command.
						Once a project is set up a developer is then required to update the settings.py file to reflect their
						database configurations, regional settings, static directories, and choose which libraries or middleware to
						use. With the new new apps can be created and registered in the setting.py file; apps are the equivalent of packages.
						These packages contain the models, views, forms, templates, URLs, etc... for their respective package.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are currently using the Django libraries for administration, authentication, sessions, and static files as outlined above.
						The student group on hopper does not have permissions to create databases as such the testing was rewritten in order to perform unit testing.

				<h3 class="heading2"><span class="number">4.3</span>Benefits to Django</h3>
					<p>
						There a several benefits to using Django over other avaialbe we frameworks. The reason Django was selected
						was because it is a industry known framework and the development team has Python experience, which has proven
						to be a great asset. A nice thing that we have discovered with Django is that it eliminates
						a lot of the work involved in setting up the administration, user login, and database. Other languages which we
						considered were Ruby, C#, PHP, and Java. Ruby, C#, and PHP were discarded due to lack of developer experience and
						the time contraints now imposed. Java was not selected because we have done a great deal of Java development and
						wished to use another language.
