				<section id="interface">
					<h2 class="section-heading"> External interface requirements </h2>
					<h3 class="subheading">User interface</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The user interface for the beer pong network is
							a dynamic website.
						</li>
						<li>
							Users log in, and the content
							changes according to their account level.
						</li>
						<li>
							Users will see a front page with their
							current statistics. They have the ability
							to create a new game.
						</li>
						<li>
							The game interface will be entirely visual,
							to simulate the experience of a Pong game.
						</li>
						<li>
							The function of the interface is to input
							data about the game into the database as easily
							and intuitively as possible.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Mobile Component</b>
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								In order to make data entry more accessible,
								we hope to implement a mobile-ready version of
								the web user interface
							</li>
							<li>
								The mobile website will be a simplified version
								of the main website &mdash; but it <em>must</em>
								be able to fully support game data entry
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="subheading"> Software interface </h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The system operates on modern, standard internet browsers (Internet Explorer 9/10,
							Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari).
						</li>
						<li>
							The system uses a database.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Analytic Algorithm</b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The system implements a library which contains an analytic algorithm
								</li>
								<li>
									The library allows us to specify what inputs we give the algorithm which then calculates the skill level in comparision to other users.
								</li>
								<li>
									Some documentation is available here <a href="https://github.com/saulabs/trueskill/blob/master/README.md">GitHub TrueSkill Readme</a>, <a href="http://trueskill.org/">TrueSkill Site</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo Rating System Documentation</a>
								</li>
								<li>
									We are permitted to use the algorithm
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>OpenID</b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The system allows a user to login with an OpenID account
								</li>
								<li>
									Supported providers are Google and FaceBook.
								</li>
								<li>
									The library allows us to grab a user's profile information from either an active session or by redirecting them to their providers login page
								</li>
								<li>
									Some documentation is available here <a href="https://github.com/openid/ruby-openid">GitHub Ruby-OpenID</a> and here <a href="http://openid.net/">The OpenID Site</a>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Facebook Login For Web</b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The system allows a user to login with their Facebook account
								</li>
								<li>
									The SDK will allow the system to grab a user's profile information
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h3 class="subheading"> communications interface (where our website is) </h3>
					<h3 class="subheading"> Specific requirements (outlines all software being used) </h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Functions (ie. software shall validate the user has used valid email address)
						</li>
						<li>

						<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Stimulus/Response Sequence<br/>
							<br/>From the main page, selecting login, a user can login to the website, or through Facebook Login.
						<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Functional Requirements<br/>

						<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Stimulus/Response Sequence<br/>
							<br/>A new game is created by a registered user. A game consists of four players. When a new game is created, the registered users invite other players to join the game, up to a maximum of 3. When three players are invited, the game starts, and the registered user who created the game sees the game user-interface.
						<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Functional Requirements<br/>
							<br/>REQ-1	The user who creates a game must be registered<br/>
							<br/>REQ-2	The user who creates the game must not be in another game at the same time<br/>
							<br/>REQ-3	There must be at least two registered users in a game<br/>
							<br/>REQ-4	Each team must have at least one registered user
						<br/><br/></li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="subheading"> Play a Game </h3>
					<ul>
					<li>Desciption<br/>
