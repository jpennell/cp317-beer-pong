			<h2 class="section">1 Introduction</h2>
			
			<h3 class="subsection">1.1 Product Purpose</h3>
			
				<p>
					The WLU Pong website is a site that provides users the chance to record and view analytics of Beer Pong games played by themselves and fellow Laurier students. WLU Pong will allow students to enter every detail of the game they are playing while they are playing the game, contributing to both society as a whole as well as individuals. This document outlines the expected project, including a description of the product, the design software interfaces, system features, as well as how the project will be approached.
				</p>
			
			<h3 class="subsection2">1.1.1 Contributions to Society</h3>
			
				<p>
					An increasing trend in today’s society is social media. As a site that allows fellow students to come together, record, and share their Beer Pong statistics, WLU Pong feeds the students’ need to stay connected, meet new people, and opportunity to share their interest of the game. WLU Pong introduces the collaboration of social media with in person interaction.				
				</p>
				
			<h3 class="subsection2">1.1.2 Contributions to Individuals</h3>
			
				<p>
					WLU Pong creates a friendly, competitive and entertaining environment for every individual involved.			
				</p>
				
			<h3 class="subsection">1.2 Terminology</h3>
			
				<p>
					Appendix A has a glossary of common terms used.
				</p>
				
			<h3 class="subsection">1.3 Audience</h3>
			
				<p>

				</p>
		
			<h3 class="subsection">1.4 Product Scope</h3>
			
				<p>
					The scope of this project serves people who want to record Beer Pong online. This is to be done by HTML pages and providing users with an interesting and webpage based interface that allows them to record, compete with other players and also the system will record them win and lose times in their account.
				</p>
				
			<h3 class="subsection">1.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>

					<br><br>
					Moreover,this section specifies completed, ongoing or future projects or the linkages to established programs, on which this project depends in order to be successful, or which are dependent on this project. (!!Now no know dependencies. Add later.)
				</p>

			<h2 class="section">2 Product description</h2>	
				
			<h3 class="subsection">2.1 Product perspective</h3>

				<h3 class="subsection2">2.1.1 What the product is</h3>
			
					<p>
						Pong Tracker is a web-based database for tracking statistics of a given individualï¿½s Beer Pong performance. It collects a number of different metrics via its intuitive real-time collection interface. Using this data, a leaderboard as well as user analytics will be readily available for users to see.
					</p>
					
				<h3 class="subsection2">2.1.2 How to use it</h3>
			
					<p>
						Users will have the ability to search other users and challenge them to a game. One user will be responsible for the operation of the interface, then following a confirmation from one member of the opposite team, will successfully store the data of one game. Pong Tracker also offers the ability to view analytics of players. The analytics page is essentially a user friendly display of all stats gathered from the interface. A leaderboard, filtered by user region or institution, will also be available to define the strongest users. To accomplish the task of ranking users, an algorithm such as Microsoft TrueSkillï¿½ will be implemented.
					</p>
					
				<h3 class="subsection2">2.1.3 Beer Pong Rules</h3>
			
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
							<b>Eye-to-eye</b> determines the first team to shoot 
								<ul>
									<li>
									Should both parties hit their eye-to-eye, eye-to-eye resumes until only one team scores
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
							Should both members of a team score, they shoot again 
							</li>
							<li>
							Should after a shot, the ball spin in the rim of the opponents' cup, the defending team may attempt to blow the ball out of the cup. If the ball is ejected and remains dry, no cup is scored
							</li>
							<li>
							<b>Air balls</b> result in a loss of turn, if it was the second shot you're lucky
							</li>
							<li>
							Should a shot roll/bounce back on the table (never once touching the ground) the shooting team member may attempt a <b>trick shot</b> 
							</li>
							<li>
							Each team is entitled to one <b>re-rack</b> at any point throughout the game
							</li>
							<li>
							Bounce shots count as two cups scored, the cup hit, as well as one selected by the offending team are counted 
								<ul>
									<li>
									The defending team may attempt to disrupt the ball once it has made contact with the table.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
							Should two non-bounce shots hit the same cup, the cup hit, as well as two selected by the offending team are counted
							</li>
							<li>
							Any knocking over of a cup is considered a <b>Party Foul</b> and all disrupted cups are to be removed at the discredit of the offender. 
							</li>
							<li>
							If the ball is disrupted by the defending team (BEFORE it has made contact with the table) a cup is lost by the defending team this is also considered a <b>Party Foul</b>
							</li>
							<li>
							Should a cup in the hand of a player be sunk, the offending team is automatically victorious and the Game Over option should be selected.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<b>Terminology</b>
							<ul>
								<li>
								<b>Air Balls:</b> A shot that misses the table altogether
								</li>
								<li>
								<b>Eye-to-eye:</b> A means of deciding the first team to shoot. Consists of a member of each team simultaneously shooting while making full eye contact with the other party. Should a cup be scored, the offending party is awarded the first shot.
								</li>
								<li>
								<b>Party Foul:</b> An infringement on the rules of the game, or knocking over a cup, spilling its contents.
								</li>
								<li>
								<b>Re-Rack:</b> A request to shuffle the orientation of the remaining cups on the opposing side.
								</li>
								<li>
								<b>Trick Shots:</b> any shot containing either multi-directional trajectory OR non-standard origination
								</li>

			<br>	
			<h2 class="section">5 Other Non-Functional Requirements</h2>	

			<h3 class="subsection">5.1 Performance Requirements</h3>
			
				<p>
					The front-end pages of the Beer-Pong site must be loaded quickly and seamlessly with little time between transitions and virtually no load time between sequential pop-ups. Automation and the front-end interface must be flawless as the database driving the Stats page will hold valuable records.
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Front-end pages must be loaded quickly and without error
						<br><br>
						As the Beer-Pong site is in its earliest stages, front-end pages must be built with fast and reliable software that can be updated easily for future enhancements and additions. Also, information searches based on previously selected data must be quick and efficient.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>Automation and the front-end interface must be quick and reliable
						<br><br>
						The Stats page in particular will contain a large database that must be built with error-free automation and load sufficient software for future growth.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h3 class="subsection">5.2 Security Requirements</h3>
			
				<p>
					For security, only two base requirements are needed which are: a login page for general users and a login page for administrative users.
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>General user login page
						<br><br>
						This will be the main hub for non-administrative users to enter the Beer-Pong site and access their personal stats, teams and records. These users will not have access to any site changes and will not even know another login page exists for admin users.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>Administrator user login page
						<br><br>
						A second login page that will exist unbeknownst to the general users as this will be where an administrator will enter the Beer-Pong site to make necessary changes and updates.
					</li>
				</ul>
