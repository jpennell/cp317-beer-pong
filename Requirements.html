				<p>
					Pong Tracker is a web-based utility for tracking statistics of a given user&#39;s beer pong performance. It collects a number of different metrics via its intuitive real-time collection interface. Using this data, a leaderboard as well as user statistics is readily available for users to see.
				</p>



				<h3 class="subsection2"><span class="numbering">2.1.2</span> Beer Pong Rules</h3>
				<h4 class="subsection3">Materials Required</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>1 table no less than 7 feet (2 m) long and no less than 2 feet ( m) wide.</li>
						<li>12 red <a href="#cup">Solo cups</a></li>
						<li>2 ping pong balls</li>
						<li>Any beverage</li>
					</ul>

				<h4 class="subsection3">Setting Up</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Twelve cups are arranged as shown below.</li>
						<li>Fill each cup a quarter of the way full with the beverage you have chosen.</li>
						<li>Players stand at the short ends of the table on their team's respective side.</li>

				<h4 class="subsection3">Gameplay</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<ul>
						<li>
							To start the game, <b>Eye-to-eye</b> determines the first team to shoot.
							<ul>
								<li>
									One person from each team begins the process. After each failed attempt, the two team members swap places.
								</li>
								<li>
									If both parties hit their eye-to-eye in a given turn, eye-to-eye resumes until only one team scores.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>
							Players take turns attempting to throw the ping pong ball into the cups of the other team. A successfully sunk cup results in that cup being removed.
						</li>
						<li>
							If both members of a team sink their cups in one turn, they shoot again.
						</li>
						<li>
							If after a shot, the ball spins in the rim of the opponents&#39; cup, the defending team may attempt to blow the ball out of the cup. If the ball is ejected and remains dry, no cup is scored.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Air balls</b> result in a loss of the current turn.
							<ul>
								<li>
									If the first shooter <b>Air Balls</b> then the second shooter must forfeit his/her shot.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the second shooter <b>Air Balls</b> then play resumes as though the turn ended normally.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If a shot rolls/bounces back to the shooting team on the table (never once touching the ground) and the shooting team gains possesion, a member may attempt a <b>trick shot</b>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Each team is entitled to one <b>re-rack</b> at any point throughout the game.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Bounce shots</strong> count as two cups scored, the cup hit, as well as one selected by the offending team.
							<ul>
								<li>
									The defending team may attempt to disrupt the ball once it has made contact with the table.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If two non-bounce shots hit the same cup, the cup hit, as well as one selected by the scoring team are counted and removed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Any knocking over of a cup is considered a <b>Party Foul</b>. All disrupted cups are to be removed and are considered scored by the other team.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the ball is disrupted by the defending team (BEFORE it has made contact with the table) a cup is lost by the defending team. This is considered a <b>Party Foul</b>
						</li>

					</ul>
				</div>

				<h4 class="subsection3">Ending a Game</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<ul>
						<li>
							If a cup in the hand of a player is sunk, the scoring team is automatically victorious and the 'Game Over' option is selected.
							<ul>
								<li>
									Losing team does not qualify for redemption
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If all the cups on one side are sunk, that team is eligible for <b>Redemption</b>.
							<ul>
								<li>
									The objective of redemption is to sink the remaining cups on the other team&#39;s side.
								</li>
								<li>
									Both players on the redeeming team keep shooting until they miss.
								</li>
								<li>
									If one player misses, the other may continue to shoot.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If both players sink the last remaining cup, or it is a bounce, the defending team is not eligible for redemption.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h3 class="subsection2"><span class="numbering">2.1.3</span> Product Usage</h3>
				<p>
					Users can search other users and challenge them to a game. Only one user, from one team is responsible for the operation of the interface. The interface offers a simulation of a beer pong game. The user selects the cup that was sunk, then the action, then the user who performed the action. Before the game is valid, a confirmation from one member of the team who wasn't tracking the game is required.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pong Tracker can view their own statistics as well as other users'. A leaderboard is available to define the strongest users.

			<section id="interface">
				<h2 class="section"><span class="numbering">3</span> External Interface Requirements</h2>
				<h3 class="subsection"><span class="numbering">3.1</span> User Interface</h3>
				<p>
				The user interface must be designed to be engaging and simple for the user. The user interface must emphasize the display of user statistics, since this is a key feature for our competitive user base.
				To make this possible, both a <b>desktop</b> and a <b>mobile</b> form factor of the website are to be developed.
				</p>
				<div class="indent">
				<ul>
					<li>
						The user interface for the Beer Pong network is a dynamic website.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users log in, and the content changes according to their account level (user vs. admin).
					</li>
					<li>
						Users see a front page with their current statistics. Users create a new game.
					</li>
					<li>
						The function of the interface is to input data about the game into the database as easily and intuitively as possible.
					</li>
					<li>
						The game interface is entirely visual and engaging in order to simulate the experience of a beer pong game.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</div>
