				<h3 class="subsection"><span class="numbering">2.1</span> Product Perspective</h3>
				<h3 class="subsection2"><span class="numbering">2.1.1</span> Product Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Pong Tracker is a web-based utility for tracking statistics of a given individual's Beer Pong performance. It collects a number of different metrics via its intuitive real-time collection interface. Using this data, a leaderboard as well as user statistics is readily available for users to see.
				</p>

				<h3 class="subsection2"><span class="numbering">2.1.2</span> Product Usage</h3>
				<p>
					Users have the ability to search other users and challenge them to a game. One user is responsible for the operation of the interface. The interface offers a simulation of what a Beer Pong game looks like in real life. The user selects the cup that was sunk, then the action, then the user who performed the action. Before the game is valid, a confirmation from one member of the opposing team is required.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pong Tracker also offers the ability for users to view their own statistics as well as other users'. A leaderboard is also available to define the strongest users. To accomplish the task of ranking users, an algorithm such as Microsoft TrueSkill needs to be implemented.
				</p>

				<h3 class="subsection2"><span class="numbering">2.1.3</span> Beer Pong Rules</h3>
				<h4>Setting Up</h4>
				<p>
					Twelve cups are arranged as shown below. The table should be no less than 7 feet long.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="PongLayout.png" alt="Beer Pong Layout" width="100%">
					<figcaption class="caption">
						Standard Arrangement of Beer Pong
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<h4>Gameplay</h4>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Eye-to-eye</b> determines the first team to shoot.
							<ul>
								<li>
									One person from each team begins the process. After each failed attempt, the two team members swap places.
								</li>
								<li>
									If both parties hit their eye-to-eye in a given turn, eye-to-eye resumes until only one team scores.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>
							Players take turns attempting to throw the ping pong ball into the cups of the other team. A successfully sunk cup results in that cup being removed.
						</li>
						<li>
							If both members of a team sink their cups in one turn, they shoot again essentially skipping the other team's turn.
						</li>
						<li>
							If after a shot, the ball spins in the rim of the opponents' cup, the defending team may attempt to blow the ball out of the cup. If the ball is ejected and remains dry, no cup is scored.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Air balls</b> result in a loss of the current turn.
							<ul>
								<li>
									If the first shooter <b>Air Balls</b> then the second shooter must forfeit his/her shot.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the second shooter <b>Air Balls</b> then play resumes as though the turn ended normally.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If a shot rolls/bounces back to the shooting team on the table (never once touching the ground) and the shooting team gains possesion, a member may attempt a <b>trick shot</b>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Each team is entitled to one <b>re-rack</b> at any point throughout the game.
						</li>
						<li>
							Bounce shots count as two cups scored, the cup hit, as well as one selected by the offending team.
							<ul>
								<li>
									To combat this, the defending team may attempt to disrupt the ball once it has made contact with the table.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If two non-bounce shots hit the same cup, the cup hit, as well as two selected by the offending team are counted and removed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Any knocking over of a cup is considered a <b>Party Foul</b> and all disrupted cups are to be removed at the discredit of the offender.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the ball is disrupted by the defending team (BEFORE it has made contact with the table) a cup is lost by the defending team. This is also considered a <b>Party Foul</b>
						</li>

					</ul>
				</p>
				<h4>Ending a Game</h4>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							If a cup in the hand of a player is sunk, the offending team is automatically victorious and the <b>Game Over</b> option is selected.
							<ul>
								<li>
									Losing team does not qualify for redemption
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If all the cups on one side are sunk, that team is eligible for <b>Redemption</b>.
							<ul>
								<li>
									The objective of redemption is to sink the remaining cups on the other team's side.
								</li>
								<li>
									Both players on the redeeming team keep shooting until they miss.
								</li>
								<li>
									If one player misses, the other may continue to shoot.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							If both players sink the last remaining cup, or it is a bounce, the defending team is not eligible for redemption.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h3 class="subsection"><span class="numbering">2.2</span> Product Functions</h3>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A user friendly, web-based application (computer and mobile) in which users can create and score beer pong games while they are being played
						</li>
						<li>
							Must have the ability to show personal statistics regarding wins, losses, cups sunk, and preferred partner
						</li>
						<li>
							Must have the ability to show which user is the best beer pong player
						</li>
					</ul>

			<section id="interface">
				<h2 class="section">3 External Interface Requirements</h2>
				<h3 class="subsection">3.1 User Interface</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The user interface for the beer pong network is a dynamic website.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users log in, and the content changes according to their account level (user vs. admin)
					</li>
					<li>
						Users see a front page with their current statistics. They have the ability to create a new game.
					</li>
					<li>
						The function of the interface is to input data about the game into the database as easily and intuitively as possible.
					</li>
					<li>
						The game interface is entirely visual and engaging in order to simulate the experience of a beer pong game.
					</li>
				</ul>
				The user interface must be designed to be engaging and simple for the user. The user interface must also emphasize the display of user statistics, since this is a key feature for our competitive user base.
				To make this possible, both a <b>desktop</b> and a <b>mobile</b> form factor of the website are to be developed.

				<h4>Desktop Site</h4>
				The desktop version sees more usage by people in their free time since it is unlikely that people have their laptop with them during agame of beer pong.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Greater range of leaderboard data
					</li>
					<li>
						More features to connect with and browse other users
					</li>
					<li>
						Access to personal account administrative features
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Mobile Site</h4>
				The mobile version, for the most part, affects the users who are currently participating in a beer pong game and are therefore interacting with the main product features.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Highly reactive, intuitive, and well-designed user interface to facilitate data entry
					</li>
					<li>
						Less emphasis on full set of social networking capabilities
