					<ol>
						<li>
							What the product is
						</li>
						<li>

						<ol>
							<li>A user friendly, web-based application (computer and mobile) in which users can create and score beer pong games while they are being played</li>
							<li>Must have the ability to show personal statistics regarding wins, losses, cups sunk, and preferred partner</li>
							<li>Must have the ability to show which end user is the best beer pong player using ranking system defined in section (insert section reference here)</li>
						</ol>
					<h3 class="subheading"> Actors and Use Cases </h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Administrator - is an individual who has special privileges within the website. An administrator can login, logout, add an institution, delete an institution, ban a user, and unban a user. Administrators and end user accounts are completely separate.</li>
							<li>End User - is an individual who uses the website for active game play. In terms of game play, the end user may create, score or confirm a game.  End users can view the entire leaderboard, login, logout, inactivate their account, view their personal statistics, and view other players’ statistics.</li>
							<li>Guest - is an individual who is not using the site for active game play. A guest may view a limited version of the leaderboard and may register. Once a guest has registered, they become an end user.</li>
						</ol>
						<ol>
							<li>Admin Login - an administrator must provide their username and password as discussed in section (reference to section here) to authenticate their identity</li>
							<li>Admin Logout - an administrator need only select the “Logout” option to have access to their account session terminated</li>
							<li>Add Institution - an administrator has the ability to add institutions that guests select when registering to become a user. </li>
							<li>Delete Institution - an administrator has the ability to delete institutions that guests select when registering to become a user.</li>
							<li>Ban User - an administrator can ban a user who has not conformed to the site’s rules or policies</li>
							<li>Unban User - an administrator can lift a ban on a user who has not confirmed to the site’s rules or policies</li>
							<li>User Login - an end user must provide their username and password as discussed in section (reference to section here) to authenticate their identity </li>
							<li>User Logout - an end user need only select the “Logout” option to have access to their account session terminated</li>
							<li>Create Game - an end user can create a beer pong game</li>
							<li>Score Game - once a beer pong game has been created, an end user uses the interface to record the results of the game as it is being played</li>
							<li>Confirm Game Results - once a game has been completed, an end user must confirm the results of the game in order for the game data in question to be used and considered in the statistics and leaderboard areas</li>
							<li>View Personal Statistics - an end user may view their personal statistics at any time given they are logged in. The statistics shown here include only games that have been confirmed by players involved in a particular game.</li>
							<li>View Other Users’ Statistics - an end user may view other players’ personal statistics at any time given they are logged in. The statistics shown here include only games that have been confirmed by players involved in a particular game.</li>
							<li>View Full Leaderboard - an end user may view the entire leaderboard at any time given they are logged in. The statistics shown here include only games that have been confirmed by players involved in a particular game.</li>
							<li>Register - a guest must provide information as stated in section (reference to section here) in order to facilitate the login functionality</li>
							<li>View Limited Leaderboard - a guest can see the top ten players on the website. For full access to the leaderboard, a guest must become a user</li>

					<h3 class="subheading"> Constraints (technical constraints) </h3>
				</section>

				<section id="interface">
					<h2 class="section-heading"> External interface requirements </h2>
					<h3 class="subheading">User interface</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The user interface for the beer pong network is
							a dynamic website.
						</li>
						<li>
							Users log in, and the content
							changes according to their account level.
						</li>
						<li>
							Users will see a front page with their
							current statistics. They have the ability
							to create a new game.
						</li>
						<li>
							The game interface will be entirely visual,
							to simulate the experience of a Pong game.
						</li>
						<li>
							The function of the interface is to input
							data about the game into the database as easily
							and intuitively as possible.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Mobile Component</b>
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								In order to make data entry more accessible,
								we hope to implement a mobile-ready version of
								the web user interface
							</li>
							<li>
								The mobile website will be a simplified version
								of the main website &mdash; but it <em>must</em>
								be able to fully support game data entry
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="subheading"> Software interface </h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The system operates on standard internet browsers (Internet Explorer 6/7/8/9/10,
							Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari).
						</li>
						<li>
							The system uses a database.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Analytic Algorithm</b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The system implements a library which contains an analytic algorithm
								</li>
								<li>
									The library allows us to specify what inputs we give the algorithm which then calculates the skill level in comparision to other users.
								</li>
								<li>
									Some documentation is available here <a href="https://github.com/saulabs/trueskill/blob/master/README.md">GitHub TrueSkill Readme</a>, <a href="http://trueskill.org/">TrueSkill Site</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo Rating System Documentation</a>
								</li>
								<li>
									We are permitted to use the algorithm
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>OpenID</b>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The system allows a user to login with an OpenID account
								</li>
								<li>
									Supported providers are Google and FaceBook.
								</li>
								<li>
									The library allows us to grab a user's profile information from either an active session or by redirecting them to their providers login page
								</li>
								<li>
									Some documentation is available here <a href="https://github.com/openid/ruby-openid">GitHub Ruby-OpenID</a> and here <a href="http://openid.net/">The OpenID Site</a>
