					<h3 class="subsection2-title">2.1.2 Beer Pong Rules</h3>

						<p>
							Listed are the rules for a game of Beer Pong, as assumed by Pong Tracker. Rules may be modified by the teams playing.
						</p>

						<div class="subsection3">

							<h4 class="subsection3-title">2.1.2.1 Gameplay</h4>

								<div class="indent10">
									<ul>
										<li>
											To determine the first team to shoot, players participate in <a href="#appendix"><b>eye-to-eye</b></a>. Eye-to-eye consists of a member from each team shooting simultaneously at the opposing team's cups while making full eye contact with the opposing shooter.
											<ul>
												<li>
													One person from each team begins. After each failed attempt, the two team members swap places.
												</li>
												<li>
													When a ball is successfully sunk, the scoring team is awarded the first shot. The cup that is sunk is not counted during eye-to-eye.
												</li>
												<li>
													If both teams hit their eye-to-eye in a given turn, eye-to-eye resumes until only one team scores.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>

										<li>
											Teams take turns attempting to throw the ping pong ball into the cups of the opposing team. The team who is currently shooting is called the <a href="#appendix"><b>shooting team</b></a>. The team who is being shot at is called the <a href="#appendix"><b>defending team</b></a>.
										</li>
										<li>
											When a ball has been sunk in a cup, that cup is removed from the table by the defending team. The defending team must drink the contents of that cup in a timely fashion (see <a href="#end">Ending a Game</a>).
										</li>
										<li>
											If both members of the shooting team sink any two of the defending team's cups in one turn, they shoot again.
										</li>
										<li>
											After a shot, the ball spins in the rim of the defending team's cup, the defending team can attempt to blow the ball out of the cup. If the ball is ejected and remains dry, no cup is removed.
										</li>
										<li>
											An <a href="#appendix"><b>air ball</b></a> is a shot that does not hit the table, nor any cup on the table.
											<ul>
												<li>
													If the first shooter air balls, then the second shooter must forfeit their shot.
												</li>
												<li>
													If the second shooter air balls, then play resumes as though the turn ended normally.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											If the ball rolls or bounces back to the shooting team on the table (never once touching the ground), a member of the shooting team can attempt a <a href="#appendix"><b>trick shot</b></a>.
										</li>
										<ul>
											<li>
												A trick shot is any shot containing either multi-directional trajectory or non-standard origination.
												<ul>
													<li>
														Bouncing the ball off an adjacent wall.
													</li>
													<li>
														Throwing the ball facing the opposite direction of the table.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												A trick shot does not follow the standard rules for shooting, such as air ball.
											</li>
											<li>
												A trick shot can not be disrupted by the defending team.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<li>
											Each team is entitled to one <a href="#appendix"><b>re-rack</b></a> at any point during the game. A re-rack is a request to shuffle the orientation of the remaining cups of the opposing team.
										</li>
										<li>
											A <a href="#appendix"><b>bounce shot</b></a> counts as two cups sunk. A bounce shot hits the table before entering a cup. The sunk cup and another chosen by the <a href="#appendix"><b>scoring team</b></a> are removed.
											<ul>
												<li>
													The defending team can attempt to disrupt the ball after it has made contact with the table.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											If two non-bounce shots hit the same cup, then the sunk cup, and another selected by the scoring team are removed.
										</li>
										<li>
											A <a href="#appendix"><b>party foul</b></a> is any infringement on the rules of the game. In particular:
										</li>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Any knocking over of a cup is considered a party foul. All disrupted cups are to be removed and are considered scored on by the opposing team.
											</li>
											<li>
												If the ball is disrupted in any way (that is not otherwise stated in the above rules) by the defending team, a cup is removed from the defending team and is considered scored on by the shooting team.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>
								</div>

							<h4 class="subsection3-title">2.1.2.2 Ending a Game</h4>

								<div class="indent10">
									<ul>
										<li>
											A game is over when a team's cups are all removed from the table.
										</li>
										<li>
											Before the game is complete, the team with no remaining cups is eligible for <a href="#appendix"><b>redemption</b></a>.
											<ul>
												<li>
													If a team is sucessful, then the game resumes, with each team having three cups.
												</li>
												<li>
													The objective of redemption is to sink the opposing team's remaining cups.
												</li>
												<li>
													Both players on the redeeming team keep shooting until they miss.
												</li>
												<li>
													If one player misses, the other continues to shoot.
												</li>
												<li>
													A team is not eligible for redemption if:
												</li>
												<ul>
													<ul>
														<li>
															Both players on the shooting team sink the defending team's remaining cup.
														</li>
														<li>
															The remaining cup is sunk via a bounce shot.
														</li>
														<li>
															A cup in the hand of a player is sunk (for example, before the player drinks).
														</li>
														<ul>
															<li>
																There is beverage remaining in the cup.
															</li>
															<li>
																The scoring team is automatically victorious.

				<h2 class="section-title">5 Other Non-Functional Requirements</h2>

				<div class="subsection1">

					<h3 class="subsection1-title">5.1 Performance Requirements</h3>

						<p>
							The front-end pages for Pong Tracker must be loaded quickly and seamlessly with little time between transitions to other pages, and the game interface's dialog boxes should take virtually no time to load. An initial user volume consisting of post-secondary students in Ontario is expected and as such the software must be built to handle this workload.
						</p>

					<h3 class="subsection1-title">5.2 Security Requirements</h3>

						<p>
							For security, there are three requirements:
						</p>

						<div class="indent10">
						<ul>
							<li>
								<i>User</i> Login Page
								<br/>
								This is the main login page for a <i>user</i> to enter Pong Tracker in order to access their personal statistics and engage in game play. These <i>users</i> do not have access to any website changes.
							</li>
							<li>
								<i>Administrator</i> Login Page
								<br/>
								A second login page exists that is invisible to <i>users</i>, where an <i>administrator</i> enters Pong Tracker to make changes to sensitive information.
							</li>
							<li>
								Password Security
								<br/>
								An encryption method must be in place to protect the passwords of <i>users</i> and <i>administrators</i>.
							</li>
						</ul>
						</div>

					<h3 class="subsection1-title">5.3 Software Quality Attributes</h3>

						<div class="subsection2">

							<h3 class="subsection2-title">5.3.1 Maintainability</h3>

							<p>
								The client expects to be able to make changes to the website in the future therefore the website must be easy to maintain and well-documented.
							</p>

							<h3 class="subsection2-title">5.3.2 Scalability</h3>

							<p>
								The website must have the potential to be expanded to handle larger amounts of users should it become more popular.
