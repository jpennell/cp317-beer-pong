		<h1>Tool Stories</h1>
		<p>
			Over the course of this project we have used several tools in an attempt to stream line our production process and improve collaboration. The main tools that 
			we used followed by a description and several opinions are listed below.
		</p>
		<ul>

			<li><h3><a href="http://www.wiggio.com" target="_blank">Wiggio</a>Stories:</h3></li>
				<p>
					Wiggio is a free group collaboration site, it provides: a group discussion board with customizable 
					email notification for posts, calendar, and document/link sharing. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I have found Wiggio to be a very helpful tool when used correctly. It has been a nice way to keep information about the project stored in a place 
					accessible by everyone and searchable. While the vast number of emails generated in a discussion could get overwhelming, customization allowed for the 
					prevention of overloaded emails. Having notifications delivered to your phone or email was also incredibly handy. Built in availability polls were 
					useful to determine the best time for meetings. Quinton

			<li><h3><a href="http://www.trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> Stories:</h3></li>
				<p>
					Trello is a free task manager and tracker user to assign tasks to a user and allow them to signal when their task is complete. A user can make multiple 
					boards for a group allowing for the different phases to have their own boards.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately I find we did not use Trello to the fullest of its capabilities; people seemed to be overwhelmed by having to check
					multiple sites for information while keeping the required html documents up to date. I have agile experience from working in the
					industry and can see that Trello is not ideally suited for that, with its lack of stories however customization can give some
					semblance of agile development. I the boards on Trello had been maintained properly I feel that it would have been very
					beneficial unfortunately we did not. Quinton

			<li><h3> <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Git </a>Stories:</h3> </li>
				<p>
					Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that can be used from a desktop with a GUI or from command line when integrated with a
					server. We used git to host and track our code and any changes made to it. Like other version control systems git allows a user to see the 
					changes made in each commit and who commited it. Here are some handy git tidbits: 
					<ul>
						<li> <a href = "https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.7.10.1/git-config.html" target ="_blank">Gitconfig File</a></li>
						<li> <a href = "http://justintallant.com/basic-unix-and-git-basics-pulling-from-and-pushing-to-github/" target ="_blank">Basic Unix and Git Basics </a></li>
						<li> <a href = "http://www.gitguys.com/topics/merging-with-a-gui/" target ="_blank">Merging With a GUI</a></li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Using Git hub was a very interesting experience for me having spent the previous four months using mercurial for this purpose. 
					When we started the project we attempted to use the GUI and a branching method designed to have simple merge conflicts if any arrived.
					Unfortunately we found that when guidelines are not followed that this can quickly become a disaster, I highly recommend to not allowing
					multiple users in the same file at the same time with any version control system. One of the flaws I found with git was poor handling of merges,
					often confusing anyone trying to merge, I would suggest that future users set up KDiff3 as their merge tool which is currently installed on hopper 
					and can be ran in NXClient. Compared to mercurial I find git to be lacking in power, the stashing feature is not present in the gui and difficult
					to use form command line. As well whenever the GUI runs into an issue it switched to command line but not until after I leaves strange markings
					in your files. A major issue we experience with git was that when doing a pull it takes the file permissions of the file from the user that 
					changed it. This meant that when deploying to production files would stop working. To remedy this, the core section of the gitconfig file can 
					be updated to keep permissions. Unfortunately this got over ridden and would not change back. Over all while git is a good tool and free, 
					I preferred mercurial. As a note I believe that mercurial can be used with git for public repositories. Quinton

			<li><h3><a href = "https://www.djangoproject.com/" target ="_blank">Django</a> Stories:</h3></li>
				<p>
					Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. In other words you code in python
					but let python do magic for you.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Django has a load of libraries and features that make developing easier; however it makes a great deal of assumptions which can lead 
					to a lot of work to overcome.  Django started off  within a few minutes you can have a full out data base and administration page provided 
					you make the same assumptions that Django does; the User model for example Django doesn’t think it needs height but do you? While the 
					internet provides several solutions to this we ran into a recurring issue of the course of the project; the solutions change for each
					version of Django making it difficult to tell if something will actually work.  While there are a lot of documentation for Django and a 
					large community asking questions it is sometimes difficult to find to a solution. A more interesting issue was that we were constantly
					finding new and better ways to do things which led to time being used to ‘fix’ functional code to improve readability, performance, and
					compilation to standards. One of the more annoying things about Django when running it on hopper is that tests require a database to run
					requiring the writing of a new test runner that does not use a database. Overall Django is incredibly powerful and a great learning experience, 
					knowing what we know now a lot of work and frustration could have been avoided. For further information please look at the Design Document. Quinton

			<li><h3>mod_wsgi Stories:</h3></li>
				<p>
					mod_wsgi allows for Django to use with an Apache server. READ THIS <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ReloadingSourceCode" target="_blank">Reloading Source Code</a>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Incorperating Django and Apache can cause a great deal of frustration for first time users (us). There is a lot of administration set up and 
					if not done correctly leads to headaches. An interesting issue is that your code stays compiled on the server even if you make changes to it.
					Once identified as the issue restarting the server seemed to be an annoting but functional fix; later is was discovered that 'touch wsgi.py'
					suffices. Two other issues which you may encounter are the dropping of part of the site url and ~s in the url. To overcome the first 
					we create a constant with our site address and added it to all requests, this may not be the best but it was all that could be determined.
					The later issue is fixed in Django 1.6 so copying the source code of the urlresolver can fix this issue. Quinton
